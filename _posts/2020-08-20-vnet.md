  A deep learning-based method for the inverse problem of reconstructing the density from the signals on the boundary. 
---


With recent developpment in deep learning techniques, we implmented a VNet architecture are to solve a computarized romography inverse problem: given the signal on the boudaries of an organ, we want to rebuild the density map of the organ, hence detecting abnormaly high density zones potienl indicators of early-onset cancer. Our main tasks were:
- Simulating the radiative transfer equation;
- Using neural networks CNN to solve the related inverse problem;
- Using a Vnet to improve anccuracy and rebuild the complete density map.
