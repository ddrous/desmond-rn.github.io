### Simulating the Fracture of Ice Floes in the Arctic
The rapid shrinking of the Arctic ice cap these last decades is seen as one of the most striking
manifestations of global warming. Our main goal in this study is to invesigate what happens when two or more ice floes collide, both in 1D and in 2D. We start by modelling an ice floe as a mass-spring-damper lattice, then we derive convergence garantees with respect to its dynamics (percussion, fracture, etc.). This work has several applications, from accurate climate modelling to the design of more resistant hull in boats that navigate the Arctic.

### Cancer Detection Using Deep Neural Networks

With recent developpment in deep learning techniques, we implmented a VNet architecture are to solve a computarized romography inverse problem: given the signal on the boudaries of an organ, we want to rebuild the density map of the organ, hence detecting abnormaly high density zones potienl indicators of early-onset cancer. Our main tasks where:
- Simulating the radiative transfer equation;
- Using neural networks CNN to solve the related inverse problem;
- Using a Vnet to improve anccuracy and rebuild the complete density map.
