### Fracture of Ice Floes in the Arctic
The rapid shrinking of the Arctic ice cap these last decades is seen as one of the most striking
manifestations of global warming. Our main goal in this study is to invesigate what happens when two or more ice floes collide, both in 1D and in 2D. We start by modelling an ice floe as a mass-spring-damper lattice, then we derive convergence garantees with respect to its dynamics (percussion, fracture, etc.). This work has several applications, from accurate climate modelling to the design of more resistant hull in boats that navigate the Arctic.

### Simulation of soft tissues with Phi-FEM
In recent years, numerical models using the Finite Elements Method (FEM) to simulate the soft tissue mechanisms of the human body have attracted a great interest. In the context of computer-assisted surgery, the simulation method should be quick, precise, and patient-specific. This work develops a new method named $\Phi$-FEM that uses a Level Set function that cancels itself at the edges of the domain. We apply it to the Poisson and the linear elasticity equation.

### Cancer Screening Using Deep Neural Networks

With recent developpment in deep learning techniques, we implmented a VNet architecture are to solve a computarized romography inverse problem: given the signal on the boudaries of an organ, we want to rebuild the density map of the organ, hence detecting abnormaly high density zones potienl indicators of early-onset cancer. Our main tasks were:
- Simulating the radiative transfer equation;
- Using neural networks CNN to solve the related inverse problem;
- Using a Vnet to improve anccuracy and rebuild the complete density map.
