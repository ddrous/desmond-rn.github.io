- __R&D Intern__ @ [Jacques-Louis Lions Laboratory](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/en/the-laboratory/?lang=fr){:target="_blank"}: Where I studied the initialization of a fracture in an elastic material and explored Gamma-convergence for the Francfort-Marigo fracture model.
- __R&D Intern__ @ [IRMA](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/){:target="_blank"}: We simulated the radiative transfer equation and used neural networks (CNN and V-Net) to solve the related inverse problem; This work is applicable to medical tomography for the detection of cancerous tissues.
- __Private Instructor__ @ [Compl√©tude](https://www.completude.com/){:target="_blank"}: This is when I did some weekly monitoring of high school students in mathematics; Additionally, I did some group tutoring during holidays.
- __Webmaster__ @ [Musica International](https://www.musicanet.org/en/){:target="_blank"}: I love music and I enjoy web development. Here, I managed a website and its database composed of millions of scores; I also maintained the showcase website, and other software.

- __Learning new skills__: I personally think my greatest skill is learning fast and efficiently. And as I'm learning, returning that knowledge by teaching makes it the best part of the journey. 
- __Data Science__: As a PhD student, I love the cross-disciplinary aspect of data science. From statistics to AI, I'm skilled in state-of-the art tools and services to lead projects.
- __Scientific Computing__: I'm always with computers; making them do things efficiently is one of the problem that keeps me awake every night.
- __Web Development__: I've been experiencing with web technologies for long. I created a platformer, built and maintained various websites, both front-end and back-end. 
- __Video creation__: It started as a hobby, and I'm now quite skilled with Blender, and the Adobe Suite for animation, character design, video editing.
